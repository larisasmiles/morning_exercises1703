   Here's a puzzle for you:
        Imagine you run a soccer league and you need to create a schedule. Each team
        plays only one game per week on Saturday.
        #### Easy
        Your league has eight teams. Generate (to the screen or to a file), a schedule that has each team play each other team exactly once.
        ##### Medium
        #Your league has two divisions of eight teams. Each team should play the other
        #teams in their division twice and the teams in the other division just once.
        ##### Hard
        Your league has four divisions of eight teams. Each team should play each team
        in their division twice and any two teams from each other division.
